              The Bangladesh protests of 2024 were a series of anti-government
              demonstrations against the administration of Prime Minister Sheikh
              Hasina. Initiated by the Bangladeshi opposition parties on 10
              December 2022, the protests continued in spite of the government
              crackdowns. Though initially low-level, with instances of
              vandalism in late 2023, the movement gained momentum in 2024.
